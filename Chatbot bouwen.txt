A benefit of running Prodigy on VM is that you can easily SSH in to make changes. To make this even more convenient you can setup VSCode to run on your VM over SSH. This way you’ll be able to work with Prodigy as if you’re working locally, while also being able to click and drag files via the user interface. (Source: https://prodi.gy/docs/deployment#ssh)
